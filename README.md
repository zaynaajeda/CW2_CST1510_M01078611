## Project Description

A command-line authentication system implementing secure password hashing
This system allows users to register accounts and log in with proper password

## Features

- Secure password hashing using bcrypt with automatic salt generation
- User registration with duplicate username prevention
- User login with password verification
- Input validation for usernames and passwords
- File-based user data persistence

## Technical Implementation

- Hashing Algorithm: bcrypt with automatic salting
- Data Storage: Plain text file ('users.txt') with comma-separated values
- Password Security: One-way hashing, no plaintext storage
- Validation: Username (3-20 alphanumeric characters), Password (6-50 characters)
